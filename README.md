## Hi, this application was written in react js. To start using it, download the npm packages and then `Happy Hacking` :)

## I used such services as:

    Firebase (Realtime Database)
    SCSS / Grid / Flex 
    Animate.css
    Redux / ReduxToolkit
    React Router Dom
    Responsive (for now only for Desktop)
